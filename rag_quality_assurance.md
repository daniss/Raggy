# RAG Quality Assurance Framework

## Overview
This document defines the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) framework for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to ensure production-ready reliability, performance, and accuracy.

## Quality Standards

### 1. Response Accuracy
- **Relevance Score**: Minimum 85% relevance between user query and retrieved context
- **Citation Accuracy**: 100% of citations must link to valid document sources
- **Factual Consistency**: LLM responses must be grounded in retrieved documents
- **No Hallucination**: Responses must not contain information not present in source documents

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- **Query Response Time**: < 3 seconds for 95th percentile
- **Embedding Generation**: < 500ms for document chunks
- **Vector Search**: < 100ms for similarity matching
- **End-to-End Latency**: < 5 seconds for complete RAG pipeline

### 3. Security Requirements
- **Encryption Integrity**: 100% pass rate for encryption/decryption tests
- **Access Control**: Zero unauthorized access to organization data
- **Data Isolation**: Perfect tenant separation (0% data leakage)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all RAG operations

### 4. System Reliability
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for valid requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to cached responses when external APIs fail
- **Recovery Time**: < 30 seconds for service restart

## Quality Assurance Tests

### Automated Test Suite

#### A. Unit Tests
- Security module encryption/decryption
- Vector embedding generation
- Document parsing and chunking
- Database operations (CRUD, search)
- API endpoint functionality

#### B. Integration Tests
- End-to-end RAG pipeline
- FastAPI ↔ Next.js communication
- Database ↔ Vector store consistency
- External API integration (LLM, embeddings)

#### C. Performance Tests
- Load testing (concurrent users)
- Stress testing (large documents)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time validation

#### D. Security Tests
- Penetration testing for data access
- Encryption strength validation
- Authentication bypass attempts
- SQL injection prevention

### Manual Quality Checks

#### Content Quality Review
- [ ] Sample 100 Q&A pairs monthly for human evaluation
- [ ] Verify citation accuracy against source documents
- [ ] Check for inappropriate or biased responses
- [ ] Validate multilingual support (if applicable)

#### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Test RAG interface usability
- [ ] Verify error message clarity
- [ ] Check mobile/responsive design
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance

## Quality Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
- Response accuracy scores
- Query processing times
- Error rates and types
- User satisfaction ratings
- System resource usage

### Quality Dashboards
- RAG performance KPIs
- Security audit results
- User feedback analytics
- System health status

## Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All automated tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Manual QA review complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time alerting configured
- [ ] Quality metrics tracking active
- [ ] User feedback collection enabled
- [ ] Regular quality reviews scheduled

## Quality Improvement Process

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Weekly**: Automated test suite execution
2. **Monthly**: Manual quality review and user feedback analysis
3. **Quarterly**: Performance benchmark review and optimization
4. **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit and penetration testing

### Issue Resolution
1. **Critical Issues** (P0): < 1 hour response, < 4 hours resolution
2. **High Priority** (P1): < 4 hours response, < 24 hours resolution  
3. **Medium Priority** (P2): < 24 hours response, < 1 week resolution
4. **Low Priority** (P3): < 1 week response, next release resolution

## Success Metrics

### Key Quality Indicators (KQIs)
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.5/5 average rating
- **Query Success Rate**: > 95% successfully answered queries
- **Response Accuracy**: > 90% human-validated accuracy
- **System Uptime**: > 99.9% availability
- **Security Incidents**: Zero major security breaches

### Quality Improvement Targets
