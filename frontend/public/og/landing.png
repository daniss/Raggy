# This is a placeholder for the Open Graph banner image
# In a real implementation, this would be a 1200x630 PNG image showing:
# - Raggy logo and branding
# - "Assistants RAG privés pour vos documents" headline
# - Visual elements showing document ingestion, AI processing, and citations
# - Trust indicators: "Hébergement UE", "DPA disponible", "Citations fiables"
# 
# For now, this placeholder file ensures the path exists for the metadata references
# The actual image should be created by a designer or using tools like Figma/Canva
