## üîß Configuration

All optimizations are configurable via environment variables:

```bash
# Core optimizations
USE_ADAPTIVE_CHUNKING=true
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_RERANKING=true
USE_QUERY_ENHANCEMENT=true
USE_SEMANTIC_CHUNKING=true

# Model configuration
EMBEDDING_MODEL=dangvantuan/sentence-camembert-base

# Performance tuning
DENSE_WEIGHT=0.7
SPARSE_WEIGHT=0.3
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
```

## üéØ Impact
