## Why These Were Archived

These components were designed for a multi-tenant SaaS platform. The new business model focuses on single-client deployments at â‚¬15,000 each, making these features unnecessary complexity for individual client installations.

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these features:

1. Copy the required files back to their original locations
2. Re-add the imports in `main.py` for backend routers
3. Update navigation/routing for frontend components
4. Apply the multi-tenant migration if needed

## Original Architecture

The multi-tenant architecture included:
- Organization-based data isolation
- Per-org rate limiting
- Centralized monitoring and analytics
- Admin dashboard for managing multiple organizations
- Usage tracking and billing integration ready

These remain available for reference but are not needed for single-client deployments.
